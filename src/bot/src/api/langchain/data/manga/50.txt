Boruto manga chapter 50 summary:

Naruto questions Boruto about their location. Boruto explains that he used the Kāma to take them to another dimension, and confesses that he doesn't know where they are, being more concerned with keeping Isshiki from destroying Konoha. Naruto thinks Boruto got this attitude from him. Isshiki rushes at them and grabs Boruto. He inspects Boruto and determines the decompression of Momoshiki's Kāma on him to be about 80% complete. Sasuke switches positions with Boruto and attempts a Chidori, but Isshiki grabs his arm and kicks him aside. Isshiki reasons that if he simply returns to Konoha, they'll merely chase him there, and decides to kill them there, hoping it'll break the villagers' will and they'll reveal Kawaki's location. Naruto is insulted by the idea, claiming they won't go easily. Kawaki dreams of Jigen's words before waking up next to Amado. Shikamaru receives reports that Naruto's, Sasuke's, Boruto's and Isshiki's chakra have disappeared. Kawaki notices his Kāma has disappeared, and Amado updates him on what has happened since he passed out. Shikamaru claims he is now free, but Kawaki points out Isshiki is still after him to brand him again. Kawaki is concerned about Isshiki being out there, but Amado points out he can only survive in Jigen's body for a few days, and they only need to avoid him branding Kawaki again. Naruto attacks Isshiki, who shrinks his Rasengan. Boruto cheers Naruto as he assaults Isshiki with chakra arms. Isshiki attacks from behind and Naruto resorts to shadow clones. Naruto holds Isshiki in place with chakra arms for Sasuke to land a Chidori, but Isshiki manifests several cubes and attacks, destroying Naruto's clones. Sasuke determines the blocks to be separate from Isshiki's shrinking abilities. He blocks Isshiki's attacks with his sword, but Isshiki shrinks it out of his grasp, knocking him down, and enlarges the sword again to kill him. Boruto notices Sasuke's dire situation and rushes at them. Shikamaru relays the others witness reports of what happened. Katasuke is concerned that Boruto isn't strong enough to oppose Isshiki, but Amado speculates Boruto has become aware of his potential value against Isshiki. Isshiki freezes when Boruto puts himself between him and Sasuke, allowing Boruto to take him to safety. Isshiki asks if Boruto wants to die, but Boruto calls his bluff, asking why he didn't kill both of them in one strike when he had the chance. He determines that Isshiki can't kill him. Amado thinks that Boruto is the key to defeating Isshiki.
