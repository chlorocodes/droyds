Boruto manga chapter 78 summary:

Shikamaru is notified that Naruto's and Hinata's chakra vanished, and he wonders if Code is involved. One of the investigators mentioned that for a moment, Kawaki's chakra signature was registered. Himawari arrives home to find it being investigated. Boruto wonders why Kawaki would do it. Shikamaru asks Ada to verify it, and she confirms Kawaki was responsible, but can't track him while he's shrunk down. Boruto leaves to search for Kawaki. Ada reviews Kawaki's conversation with Naruto, and announces Kawaki might be trying to kill Boruto again. Sarada is shocked to learn that Kawaki killed Boruto before, having thought it was Code. Shikamaru explains to her that Boruto asked for it to protect them from Momoshiki, likely the same reason he might try again. Sumire tries to stop her, and Shikamaru warns her that Kawaki can't be reasoned with as he's too unstable. Sarada is frustrated that she only learned Boruto was killed after he was resurrected, unaware he was even in danger. She feels she can't do nothing when she does know, and leaves against Shikamaru's orders. Kawaki intercepts Boruto on his way home on the Hokage Rock, trying to send him away as well. Boruto stops it with his Kāma. He returns to normal size and explains where he sent Naruto and Hinata away with Daikokuten, the dimension they're in frozen in time, so they won't die or starve. Kawaki attacks Boruto with the cubes and his transformed arm. Boruto tries reasoning with him, but Kawaki is focused on killing him over being an Ōtsutsuki. The two continue fighting. Sai updates Amado on the developments, Sukunahikona making it difficult to pin him down, and that Kawaki's noncooperation might require use of extreme measures. Sarada arrives and attacks Kawaki, who absorbs her Fire Release. He tells her not to interfere, and Boruto wants her to run. Sarada thinks it's all reason for her to stay, as a shinobi who aims to become Hokage. Kawaki thinks shinobi are truly fated to die early and slashes at her. Boruto jumps in front of it, protecting her, but gets his right eye slashed and it leaves a permanent scar on his face. He wants her to move aside. Mitsuki extends his arm, holding Kawaki's, and Shikamaru paralyses him with his shadow, which prevents Kawaki from shrinking. Mitsuki blocks Kawaki's arm so he can't absorb jutsu with his Kāma. Sasuke holds a sword to Kawaki's neck, warning him against resisting. Konohamaru helps Boruto. Shikamaru asks what Kawaki did to Naruto and Hinata. He says what he had to do for their sake and Konoha's. They can't reach an understanding. Momoshiki manifests through Boruto, and absorbs Shikamaru's jutsu, freeing Kawaki to shrink away from Mitsuki. Momoshiki tells Kawaki he can't afford himself to be taken in if he wants to kill Momoshiki. Kawaki is confused by Momoshiki's assistance, who urges him not to waste the opportunity. He shrinks again in time to evade Mitsuki. Shikamaru reasons that Kawaki's extensive shrinking will take a toll on his chakra, and they should strike when he's recovering, ordering the shinobi to look for him. Sasuke wonders why Momoshiki would help Kawaki, who wants him dead. Boruto returns, and Sarada blames herself for his eye. Boruto blames Kawaki, which Mitsuki agrees with. Boruto sees Momoshiki, who tells him he lost one of his blue eyes already, adding that the ending has begun, and can no longer be stopped.
